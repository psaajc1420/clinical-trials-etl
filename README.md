# Clinical Trials

This guide will walk you through the process of fetching data from the Clinical Trials API using the AWS Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA) and Amazon Managed Streaming for Kafka (Amazon MSK).

### Prerequisites

An AWS account
Access to the Clinical Trials API
Knowledge of Apache Airflow and Kafka

### Step 1: Create a MWAA Environment

In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the MWAA service
Click on the "Create environment" button
Fill in the required information, including the environment name and the Airflow version
Click on the "Create environment" button to create the environment

### Step 2: Create a Kafka Cluster in Amazon MSK

In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the Amazon MSK service
Click on the "Create cluster" button
Fill in the required information, including the cluster name and the number of broker nodes
Click on the "Create cluster" button to create the cluster

### Step 3: Create a DAG in Airflow

In the MWAA environment, navigate to the Airflow UI
Click on the "Create" button to create a new DAG
In the DAG file, import the necessary modules and libraries for connecting to the Clinical Trials API and Kafka
Create a PythonOperator task to fetch data from the Clinical Trials API
Create a KafkaProducerOperator task to send the data to the Kafka topic
Set the task dependencies and schedule the DAG to run at the desired interval

### Step 4: Configure the Kafka Topic in Amazon MSK

In the Amazon MSK service, navigate to the cluster that you created
Click on the "Create topic" button to create a new topic
Fill in the required information, including the topic name and the number of partitions
Click on the "Create topic" button to create the topic

### Step 5: Start the DAG and consume the data

In the Airflow UI, start the DAG that you created
The data will be fetched from the Clinical Trials API and sent to the Kafka topic
Use a Kafka consumer to consume the data from the topic
Note: The above instructions are high level instructions and there might be additional steps or configurations needed based on your specific use case.
